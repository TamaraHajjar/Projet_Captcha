# DArk WEb CAptchas: An Approach To Break Dark Web Object Recognition CAPTCHAs

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based classifier for object recognition CAPTCHAs in the Abacus dataset.

Abacus is a hybrid collection of CAPTCHA images gathered from the Dark Web, divided into two distinct categories: object recognition CAPTCHAs and text-based CAPTCHAs.

To build an effective classifier, object recognition CAPTCHAs require preprocessing due to the high level of noise and obfuscation present in their raw format.

As part of this project, we introduce DaWeCa, a comprehensive approach that integrates advanced preprocessing techniques and a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately classify CAPTCHA images.

The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an accuracy rate close to 99%, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving object recognition CAPTCHAs.
